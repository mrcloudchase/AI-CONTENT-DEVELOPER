    "thinking": "I began by systematically analyzing the repository structure, focusing on directories most relevant to AKS and networking technologies. The content goal is to document Cilium for AKS, specifically its integration with Azure CNI and advanced networking features. The materials context highlights AKS, Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, and related network policy and observability concepts. I searched for directories under 'articles' that directly relate to AKS or Kubernetes networking. The closest matches are: (1) 'articles/azure-arc/kubernetes', which contains extensive Kubernetes and networking documentation, including conceptual overviews, tutorials, and integration guides; (2) 'articles/azure-linux', which is more OS-focused; and (3) 'articles/container-registry', which is about container images, not networking. 'articles/azure-arc/kubernetes' is the most relevant, as it already houses Kubernetes networking, RBAC, and extension documentation, and aligns with the advanced AKS networking and Cilium integration described in the materials. I verified that this directory exists exactly as written.",
