    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) PRD document focused on integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI. First, I identified the document as a Product Requirement Document (PRD) detailing networking enhancements for AKS. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Cilium, Azure CNI, and Kubernetes. Key concepts include dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, and observability. Microsoft products referenced are Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Monitor. The document outlines business objectives, functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and future considerations, providing a comprehensive view of the proposed feature's purpose and implementation strategy.",
