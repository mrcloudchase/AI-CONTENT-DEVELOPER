    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) PRD document. First, I identified this as a Product Requirement Document focused on integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI. I extracted specific technologies including Azure CNI, Cilium, and Kubernetes. Key concepts include dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, and operational efficiency. The Microsoft products mentioned are Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Monitor. The document outlines business objectives, user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, and future considerations, providing a comprehensive overview of the feature's purpose and implementation strategy.",
