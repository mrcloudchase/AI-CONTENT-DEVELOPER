    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) PRD document. First, I identified this as a Product Requirement Document (PRD) focused on integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, and Azure Monitor. Key concepts include dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, and operational efficiency. The Microsoft products referenced are Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Portal, and Azure Active Directory. The document outlines business objectives, functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and future considerations for enhancing AKS's networking capabilities. It emphasizes the importance of security, performance, and usability in the context of cloud-native applications.",
