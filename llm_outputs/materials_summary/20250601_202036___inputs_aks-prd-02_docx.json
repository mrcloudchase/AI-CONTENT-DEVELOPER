    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) PRD document, focusing on the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI. I identified the document as a Product Requirement Document (PRD) that outlines the feature's purpose, business objectives, and technical specifications. I extracted technologies such as Cilium, Azure CNI, and Kubernetes, along with key concepts like endpoint management, network policy enforcement, and observability. The Microsoft products mentioned include Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Monitor. The document provides a comprehensive overview of the feature's requirements, user scenarios, and operational considerations, emphasizing enhanced networking capabilities and security for cloud-native applications.",
