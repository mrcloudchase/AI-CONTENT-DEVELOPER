    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) PRD document. First, I identified it as a product requirement document focused on enhancing AKS's networking capabilities through the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Cilium, Azure CNI, and Kubernetes. Key concepts included dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, and operational efficiency. Microsoft products referenced are Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Monitor. The document outlines business objectives, functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and future considerations, providing a comprehensive framework for the feature's design and implementation.",
