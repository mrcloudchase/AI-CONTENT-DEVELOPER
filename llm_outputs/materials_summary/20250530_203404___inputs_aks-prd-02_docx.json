    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) PRD document. First, I identified it as a Product Requirement Document (PRD) focused on integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI. I extracted specific technologies such as Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, and Azure Monitor. Key concepts included dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, and operational efficiency. The Microsoft products mentioned are Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Monitor. The document outlines the business objectives, functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and future considerations for enhancing AKS's networking capabilities, emphasizing security, scalability, and developer experience.",

    "summary": "This Product Requirement Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to enhance networking capabilities. It details business objectives such as improved networking efficiency, security, and operational cost efficiency. The document specifies functional requirements for endpoint management, network policy enforcement, and observability through Azure Monitor. It also addresses non-functional requirements like performance and scalability, ensuring the solution can handle large-scale deployments. The PRD serves as a comprehensive guide for the design, development, and implementation of this feature, aiming to position AKS as a leader in managed Kubernetes solutions.",
