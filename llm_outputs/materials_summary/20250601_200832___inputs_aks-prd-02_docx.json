    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) PRD document focusing on the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI. First, I identified the document as a Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlining the feature's objectives and specifications. I extracted technologies such as Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics. Key concepts included dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, and operational efficiency. Microsoft products mentioned were Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Portal. The document emphasizes enhancing networking capabilities in AKS, detailing user scenarios, functional and non-functional requirements, and future considerations for development. It provides a comprehensive overview of the feature's purpose, scope, and technical value in improving cloud-native application performance.",
