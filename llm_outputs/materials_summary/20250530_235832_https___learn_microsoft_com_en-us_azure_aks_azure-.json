    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the document on configuring Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). First, I identified the document as a technical implementation guide focused on advanced networking configurations. I extracted specific technologies such as Azure CNI, Cilium, Kubernetes, and eBPF. Key concepts include network policies, IP address management, and observability of cluster traffic. Microsoft products mentioned are Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CLI, and Azure Virtual Network. The document provides detailed instructions for deploying Azure CNI with Cilium, including various methods for assigning pod IPs, limitations, prerequisites, and frequently asked questions, making it a valuable resource for users looking to enhance their AKS networking capabilities.",
