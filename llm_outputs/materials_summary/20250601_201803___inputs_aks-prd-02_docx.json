    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) PRD document. First, I identified it as a Product Requirements Document (PRD) focused on integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI to enhance AKS's networking capabilities. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Azure CNI, Cilium, and Kubernetes. Key concepts include dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, and operational efficiency. The Microsoft products referenced are Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Monitor. The document outlines business objectives, user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, and future considerations for the feature's development and deployment. This analysis provides insights into the technical value and strategic goals of the integration.",
