    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure CNI Powered by Cilium documentation. Initially, I identified this as a technical guide focused on configuring advanced networking in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Cilium. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Azure CNI, Cilium, Kubernetes, and eBPF. Key concepts include network policies, IP address management, and the benefits of using Cilium for observability and security. Microsoft products referenced are Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CLI, and Azure Virtual Network. The document provides detailed instructions for deploying Cilium, limitations, prerequisites, and configuration examples, making it a valuable resource for users looking to enhance their AKS networking capabilities.",
