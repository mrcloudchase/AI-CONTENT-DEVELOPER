    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) PRD document focused on the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI. First, I identified the document as a Product Requirement Document (PRD) detailing feature specifications. I extracted technologies such as Azure Kubernetes Service, Cilium, and Azure CNI. Key concepts include dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, and operational efficiency. Microsoft products mentioned are Azure Monitor and Azure Active Directory. The document outlines business objectives, user scenarios, functional and non-functional requirements, and future considerations, providing a comprehensive roadmap for enhancing AKS networking capabilities.",

    "summary": "This Product Requirement Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI within Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The primary goal is to enhance networking capabilities by enabling dynamic management of service endpoints and enforcing advanced network policies. The document details business objectives such as improved security, operational cost efficiency, and developer experience, alongside user scenarios and functional requirements. It emphasizes the importance of observability through Azure Monitor and outlines non-functional requirements focusing on performance, scalability, and security. The PRD serves as a comprehensive guide for the design, development, and implementation phases of this feature.",
