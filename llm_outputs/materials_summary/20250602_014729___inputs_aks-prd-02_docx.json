    "thinking": "I carefully read through the entire PRD document, noting its structure and extracting all explicit references to technologies, concepts, and Microsoft/Azure products. The document is a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). I identified all mentioned technologies: Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, CiliumEndpointSlices, Endpoint Slices, RBAC, CI/CD, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Azure Active Directory. Key concepts include dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, scalability, reliability, security, usability, maintainability, backward compatibility, and integration with Azure services. Microsoft products and services mentioned are Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure CNI, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Portal, Azure Active Directory, and ARM templates. I validated each extraction against the content to ensure accuracy. The summary synthesizes the document's purpose (enhancing AKS networking), scope (requirements, use cases, technical and business objectives), and technical value (advanced endpoint management, security, and observability).",

    "summary": "This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium into Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The feature aims to enhance AKS networking by enabling dynamic endpoint management, advanced network policy enforcement, and improved observability. The document details business objectives such as operational efficiency, security, and competitive differentiation, and specifies functional and non-functional requirements for integration, configuration, scalability, and reliability. It describes user scenarios for cluster operators, network administrators, developers, and security engineers, and lists dependencies on Cilium, Azure CNI, and Azure monitoring tools. The PRD also covers future considerations like analytics, UI enhancements, and multi-cloud support, ensuring AKS remains a leading managed Kubernetes solution for enterprise-scale, cloud-native applications.",
