    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the document on configuring Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). First, I identified the document as a technical implementation guide focused on advanced networking configurations within Kubernetes. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Azure CNI, Cilium, Kubernetes, and eBPF. Key concepts include network policy enforcement, IP address management, and cluster observability. The Microsoft products referenced are Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CLI, and Azure Virtual Network. The document provides detailed instructions on deploying Azure CNI with Cilium, including command-line examples for creating AKS clusters with different networking configurations. It also outlines limitations and prerequisites for successful implementation.",
