    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) PRD document. First, I identified this as a product requirement document focused on enhancing AKS networking capabilities through the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Azure CNI, Cilium, and Kubernetes, along with key concepts such as dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, and observability. Microsoft products referenced are Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Monitor. The document outlines business objectives, user scenarios, functional and non-functional requirements, and future considerations, providing a comprehensive overview of the feature's purpose and technical value.",
