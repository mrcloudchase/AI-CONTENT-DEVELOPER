    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the document on configuring Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). First, I identified the document as a technical guide focused on networking in Kubernetes environments. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Azure CNI, Cilium, Kubernetes, and eBPF. Key concepts included network policy enforcement, IP address management, and the advantages of using Cilium for observability and security. Microsoft products referenced were Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CLI, and Azure Virtual Network. The document provides detailed instructions on deploying Cilium with AKS, including command-line examples and considerations for network policies and limitations.",
