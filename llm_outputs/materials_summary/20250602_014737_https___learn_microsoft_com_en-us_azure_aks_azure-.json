    "thinking": "I began by thoroughly reading the entire document, noting its structure as a technical guide for configuring Azure CNI powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). I identified the main topic as the integration of Cilium with Azure CNI for enhanced Kubernetes networking. I systematically extracted all technologies and tools explicitly mentioned: Azure CNI, Cilium, Kubernetes, eBPF, Azure CLI, CiliumEndpointSlices, Kube-Proxy, Calico, Azure Network Policy Manager, ARM templates, REST API. For key concepts, I cataloged network policy enforcement, IP address management (IPAM), overlay and virtual network modes, observability, FQDN filtering, Layer 7 policies, cluster scaling, and limitations. I listed all Microsoft/Azure products and services: Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CLI, Azure Virtual Network, Azure Resource Manager, Microsoft.Network, Azure Container Networking Services. I validated that each extracted item is explicitly present in the source. Finally, I synthesized these findings into a comprehensive summary, ensuring all required details are included and formatted the output as specified.",

    "summary": "This document is a comprehensive technical implementation guide for configuring Azure CNI powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It details how Azure CNI integrates with the Cilium data plane to deliver high-performance networking, advanced network policy enforcement, and improved observability for Kubernetes clusters. The guide covers deployment options for pod IP assignment, including overlay networks and virtual networks, and provides step-by-step CLI commands for each scenario. It outlines the supported Kubernetes and Cilium versions, discusses limitations such as lack of Windows support and specific network policy constraints, and clarifies which Cilium features are available with and without Advanced Container Networking Services. The document also addresses frequently asked questions, troubleshooting, and best practices for leveraging Cilium's eBPF-based capabilities in AKS, making it a valuable resource for Azure cloud and Kubernetes administrators.",
