    "thinking": "I began by thoroughly reading the entire PRD document, noting its structure and focus. The document is a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new AKS feature: integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium. I systematically extracted all technologies, tools, and frameworks explicitly mentioned: Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, CiliumEndpointSlices, Endpoint Slices, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Active Directory, RBAC, and CI/CD. I identified key concepts such as dynamic endpoint management, advanced network policy enforcement, observability, scalability, reliability, security, usability, maintainability, and backward compatibility. For Microsoft/Azure products, I listed Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure CNI, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Active Directory, and Azure Portal. I validated that each item was present in the source. The main topic is the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI in AKS. The document type is a Product Requirements Document. I synthesized a summary covering the purpose (enhancing AKS networking), scope (requirements, use cases, technical and business objectives), and technical value (scalability, security, observability, and operational efficiency). All findings are structured in the required JSON format.",

    "summary": "This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The feature aims to enhance AKS networking by enabling dynamic endpoint management, advanced network policy enforcement, and improved observability. It details business objectives such as operational efficiency, security, scalability, and competitive differentiation. Functional requirements cover integration, configuration, endpoint slice management, policy enforcement, and observability, while non-functional requirements address performance, scalability, reliability, security, usability, and maintainability. The document also specifies dependencies, assumptions, a phased timeline, and future considerations like analytics and multi-cloud support. This integration positions AKS as a leading managed Kubernetes platform with state-of-the-art networking capabilities for enterprise and cloud-native workloads.",
