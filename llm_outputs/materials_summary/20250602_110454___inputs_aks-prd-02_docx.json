    "thinking": "I began by reading the entire document to understand its structure and content. The document is a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), specifically focusing on the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium. I identified all technologies and tools explicitly mentioned: Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, CiliumEndpointSlices, Endpoint Slices, RBAC, CI/CD, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and ARM templates. I then extracted key concepts such as dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, scalability, reliability, security, usability, maintainability, backward compatibility, and integration/configuration. For Microsoft/Azure products, I listed Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CNI, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Portal, Azure Active Directory, and ARM templates. I confirmed these extractions by cross-referencing each item with the source. The document type is clearly a Product Requirements Document. Finally, I synthesized a summary that captures the document's purpose, scope, and technical value, ensuring all instructions and formatting requirements are strictly followed.",

    "summary": "This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The feature aims to enhance AKS networking by enabling dynamic endpoint management, advanced network policy enforcement, and improved observability. It details business objectives such as improved efficiency, security, and operational cost savings, and provides comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements. The document addresses user scenarios for operators, administrators, developers, and security engineers, and specifies integration points with Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Azure Portal. It also covers scalability, reliability, security, and maintainability, ensuring backward compatibility and robust fallback mechanisms. The PRD includes a phased timeline, future considerations for analytics and multi-cloud support, and a glossary of key terms, serving as a blueprint for the design, development, and deployment of this advanced AKS networking feature.",
