    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the document regarding Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). First, I identified the document as a technical implementation guide focused on configuring advanced networking in AKS using Cilium. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Azure CNI, Cilium, Kubernetes, and eBPF. Key concepts included network policy enforcement, IP address management, and cluster observability. Microsoft products referenced were Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Virtual Network. The document provides detailed instructions on deploying Cilium, including prerequisites, configuration options, and limitations, making it a valuable resource for implementing advanced networking features in AKS.",
