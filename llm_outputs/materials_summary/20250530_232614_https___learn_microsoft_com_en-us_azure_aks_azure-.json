    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the document on configuring Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). First, I identified the document as a technical implementation guide focused on advanced networking solutions within AKS. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Azure CNI, Cilium, Kubernetes, and eBPF. Key concepts include network policy enforcement, IP address management, and cluster observability. The Microsoft products referenced are Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CLI, and Azure Virtual Network. The document provides detailed instructions on deploying Azure CNI with Cilium, including various methods for assigning pod IPs and the limitations associated with the service. It also discusses prerequisites and considerations for optimal configuration.",
