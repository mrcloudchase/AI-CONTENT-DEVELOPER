    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) PRD document. First, I identified this as a Product Requirement Document (PRD) focused on integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI in AKS. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Cilium, Azure CNI, and Kubernetes. Key concepts include dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, and operational efficiency. Microsoft products referenced are Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Monitor. The document outlines business objectives, functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and future considerations, providing a comprehensive framework for enhancing AKS's networking capabilities.",
