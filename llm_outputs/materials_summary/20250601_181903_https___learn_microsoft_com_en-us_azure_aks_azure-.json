    "thinking": "I systematically analyzed the document on configuring Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). First, I identified this as a technical implementation guide focused on advanced networking configurations within Kubernetes. I extracted specific technologies mentioned, including Azure CNI, Cilium, Kubernetes, and eBPF. Key concepts include network policies, IP address management, and cluster observability. Microsoft products referenced are Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CLI, and Azure Virtual Network. The document provides detailed instructions for deploying Azure CNI with Cilium, including various methods for assigning pod IPs, limitations of the configuration, and prerequisites for successful deployment. It also addresses frequently asked questions regarding customization and features of Cilium within AKS.",
