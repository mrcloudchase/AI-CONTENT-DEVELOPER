    "thinking": "1. I thoroughly read the entire document, noting its structure as a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 2. I identified the main topic as the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium, aimed at enhancing AKS networking. 3. I extracted all technologies and tools explicitly mentioned: Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, CiliumEndpointSlices, Endpoint Slices, RBAC, CI/CD, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and ARM templates. 4. I listed key concepts such as dynamic endpoint management, advanced network policy enforcement, observability, scalability, security, backward compatibility, and integration with Azure services. 5. I cataloged all Microsoft/Azure products referenced: Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Portal, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Active Directory, Azure Resource Manager (ARM templates), and Azure infrastructure components. 6. I validated that each extracted item is present in the source. 7. I synthesized a summary covering the document\u2019s purpose (defining requirements for the new feature), its scope (functional, non-functional, business rationale, user scenarios, dependencies, and timeline), and its technical value (enhanced networking, security, observability, and operational efficiency for AKS). 8. I structured all findings into the required JSON format, ensuring all type and content requirements are strictly met.",

    "summary": "This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The feature aims to enhance AKS networking by enabling dynamic endpoint grouping, advanced network policy enforcement, and improved observability. It details business objectives such as operational efficiency, security, scalability, and competitive differentiation. The document specifies functional and non-functional requirements, including real-time endpoint management, integration with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, and strict security and reliability targets. User scenarios span cluster operators, network administrators, developers, and security engineers. Dependencies include the latest Cilium release and Azure CNI components. The PRD also addresses backward compatibility, future enhancements, and a phased rollout plan, ensuring AKS remains a leading managed Kubernetes solution with state-of-the-art networking capabilities.",
