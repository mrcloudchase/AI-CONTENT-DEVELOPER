    "thinking": "1. I carefully read through the entire document to understand its structure, content, and technical focus. 2. I identified the document as a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new AKS networking feature. 3. I extracted all technologies, tools, and frameworks mentioned, including Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, Endpoint Slices, RBAC, and CI/CD. 4. I listed all key concepts such as dynamic endpoint management, advanced network policy enforcement, observability, scalability, and backward compatibility. 5. I identified all Microsoft/Azure products referenced, including Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CNI, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Portal, and Azure Active Directory. 6. I validated that each extracted item is explicitly mentioned in the source content. 7. I synthesized a comprehensive summary that covers the document\u2019s purpose (defining requirements for integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI in AKS), its scope (functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, dependencies, timeline), and its technical value (enhanced networking, security, observability, and operational efficiency for AKS users). 8. I formatted all findings into the required JSON structure, ensuring all fields are present, correctly typed, and arrays contain only strings.",

    "summary": "This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium into Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The feature aims to enhance AKS networking by enabling dynamic endpoint grouping, advanced network policy enforcement, and improved observability. It details business objectives such as operational efficiency, security, and competitive differentiation, and provides comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements. The document addresses user scenarios for cluster operators, network administrators, developers, and security engineers, focusing on scalability, reliability, and ease of configuration. Dependencies include the latest Cilium release and integration with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics. The PRD also covers future considerations like enhanced analytics, UI improvements, and multi-cloud support, ensuring AKS remains at the forefront of managed Kubernetes networking.",
