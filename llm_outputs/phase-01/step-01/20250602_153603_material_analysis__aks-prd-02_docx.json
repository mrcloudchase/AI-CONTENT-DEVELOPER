    "thinking": "I began by thoroughly reading the entire document, identifying it as a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new AKS feature: support for CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium. I noted all explicit mentions of technologies, tools, and frameworks, including Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, Endpoint Slices, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, ARM templates, RBAC, and CI/CD. I extracted key concepts such as dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, scalability, reliability, security, usability, maintainability, and backward compatibility. For Microsoft/Azure products, I listed Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure CNI, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Portal, Azure Active Directory, and ARM templates. I validated each extraction by cross-referencing the content, ensuring no fabrication. I then synthesized a summary emphasizing the document's purpose (defining requirements for integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI in AKS), scope (business objectives, functional/non-functional requirements, user stories, dependencies, timeline), and technical value (enhanced networking, security, observability, and operational efficiency for AKS). Finally, I formatted all findings into the required JSON structure, ensuring type and content accuracy.",

    "summary": "This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium into Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The feature aims to enhance AKS networking by enabling dynamic endpoint grouping, advanced network policy enforcement, and improved observability through Azure Monitor and Cilium tools. It details business objectives such as networking efficiency, security, operational cost reduction, and competitive differentiation. The PRD specifies functional and non-functional requirements, including real-time endpoint management, policy enforcement, integration with Azure services, and robust fallback mechanisms. It also covers user scenarios, dependencies (e.g., on Cilium and Azure CNI), and a phased implementation timeline. The document emphasizes scalability, reliability, and ease of use, positioning AKS as a leader in managed Kubernetes networking. Future considerations include analytics enhancements, UI improvements, and multi-cloud support.",
