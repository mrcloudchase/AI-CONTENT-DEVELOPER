==================================================

=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert at extracting structured information from documents.
You can identify and extract key concepts, technical details, and relationships.

CRITICAL: You MUST follow JSON type specifications exactly. Always return the requested structure with correct types.

=== USER ===
Extract information for: Validate directory selection matches service area and is appropriate for documentation

From this content:
Selected directory: articles/azure-arc/kubernetes
Repository structure insights: Sections found: 7, Terminal sections: 10, Flow: The repository is organized by Azure service, with each service directory containing feature or topi..., Topics: Azure Arc, Azure Linux, Azure Portal, Azure Container Registry, Azure Copilot
Service area: aks
Content goal: document cilium for aks

Validate:
1. Is this an appropriate documentation directory (not media/assets)?
2. Does this directory match the service area 'aks'?
3. If not, what would be a better directory for aks content?

VALIDATION APPROACH:
- Understand the repository's organizational pattern
- Evaluate if the selected directory fits that pattern
- Consider practical constraints (what directories actually exist)
- Validate the reasoning, not rigid rules

Return a JSON response with:
{
    "thinking": "Your numbered validation steps:
1. Repository structure analysis...
2. Directory pattern evaluation...
3. Practical constraints check...
4. Final validation decision...",  // STRING with numbered steps
    "is_valid": true/false,  // BOOLEAN - is the selection reasonable given available options?
    "is_documentation_directory": true/false,  // BOOLEAN - is it for docs (not media/assets)?
    "pattern_match": "How well does selection fit the repository pattern",  // STRING
    "reason": "Explanation of validation result",  // STRING
    "concerns": ["array", "of", "any", "concerns"],  // LIST of strings or empty
    "suggested_alternative": "Better directory path only if current is clearly wrong"  // STRING or null
}

VALIDATION PRINCIPLES:
- Accept practical decisions when ideal options don't exist
- Media/assets/includes directories are NOT valid for documentation
- If no perfect match exists, a general directory is acceptable
- Consider the repository's actual structure, not theoretical ideals
- Only suggest alternatives if they actually exist and are clearly better

TYPE REQUIREMENTS:
- thinking: MUST be a string with numbered steps (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- is_valid: MUST be a boolean (true/false)
- is_documentation_directory: MUST be a boolean
- pattern_match: MUST be a string
- reason: MUST be a string
- concerns: MUST be an array/list of strings (can be empty)
- suggested_alternative: MUST be a string or null
