    "thinking": "I analyzed the repository structure and identified a service-based organizational pattern, with top-level directories under /articles/ corresponding to Azure services (e.g., azure-arc, azure-linux, azure-portal, container-registry). There is no dedicated /aks/ or /kubernetes/ folder at the top level, but within /articles/azure-arc/, there is a kubernetes/ subdirectory containing technical documentation on Kubernetes-related features, networking, and extensions. This subfolder includes advanced Kubernetes topics such as network requirements, managed extensions, and policy references, which closely align with the technical scope of Cilium for AKS. I considered these options: /articles/azure-arc/kubernetes/, /articles/azure-arc/, and the general /articles/ folder. Of these, /articles/azure-arc/kubernetes/ is the most specific and relevant, as it already houses Kubernetes networking and extension documentation, making it the best fit for Cilium on AKS content. This directory exists and matches the established pattern for Kubernetes-related Azure documentation.",
