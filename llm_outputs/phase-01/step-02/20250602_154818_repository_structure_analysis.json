    "thinking": "1. I observed that the structure is a repository tree, with 'articles/' as the main documentation source folder. 2. Inside 'articles/', there are multiple subdirectories, each named after an Azure service or feature area (e.g., azure-arc, azure-linux, container-registry, copilot, lighthouse, quotas). 3. Each service directory contains further subdirectories for features or documentation types, such as includes, media, and specific feature folders. 4. I identified terminal sections as files or folders that are not content sections themselves, such as README.md, LICENSE, media, and includes. 5. The overall organization is hierarchical, starting from broad service areas and drilling down into feature-specific documentation or supporting assets.",
