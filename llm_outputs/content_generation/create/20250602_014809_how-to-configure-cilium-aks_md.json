By leveraging eBPF and CiliumEndpointSlices, AKS clusters gain dynamic endpoint management, improved service discovery, and efficient network policy enforcement. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for platform engineers to enable, configure, and validate Cilium with Azure CNI in AKS, including best practices for managing CiliumEndpointSlices.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> CiliumEndpointSlices are supported in AKS clusters running Kubernetes version 1.32 and above. Ensure your cluster version meets this requirement before proceeding.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Familiarity with AKS cluster creation and management\n- Azure CLI version 2.48.1 or later installed and logged in\n- Sufficient permissions to create and configure AKS clusters\n- Basic understanding of Kubernetes networking concepts\n- For CiliumEndpointSlices, Kubernetes version 1.32 or later is required\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Cilium is only available for Linux-based AKS clusters. Windows node pools are not supported.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Run `az --version` to verify your Azure CLI version. Upgrade if necessary to meet the minimum required version.\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Choose a Pod IP Assignment Mode\n\nCilium with Azure CNI supports multiple pod IP assignment modes. Select the mode that fits your network design:\n\n- **Overlay network**: Assigns pod IPs from a dedicated CIDR, independent of your VNet.\n- **Virtual network**: Assigns pod IPs from a dedicated subnet within your Azure VNet.\n- **Node subnet**: Assigns pod IPs from the node subnet.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For overlay and virtual network modes, you must specify the appropriate network and subnet parameters during cluster creation.\n\n### 2. Create a New AKS Cluster with Cilium as the Network Dataplane\n\n#### [Overlay Network](#tab/overlay)\n\n```azurecli\naz aks create \\\n  --name <clusterName> \\\n  --resource-group <resourceGroupName> \\\n  --location <location> \\\n  --network-plugin azure \\\n  --network-plugin-mode overlay \\\n  --pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \\\n  --network-dataplane cilium \\\n  --generate-ssh-keys\n```\n\n#### [Virtual Network](#tab/vnet)\n\n```azurecli\n# Create the resource group\naz group create --name <resourceGroupName> --location <location>\n\n# Create a virtual network and subnets\naz network vnet create \\\n  --resource-group <resourceGroupName> \\\n  --location <location> \\\n  --name <vnetName> \\\n  --address-prefixes <vnetAddressPrefix> -o none\n\naz network vnet subnet create \\\n  --resource-group <resourceGroupName> \\\n  --vnet-name <vnetName> \\\n  --name nodesubnet \\\n  --address-prefixes <nodeSubnetPrefix> -o none\n\naz network vnet subnet create \\\n  --resource-group <resourceGroupName> \\\n  --vnet-name <vnetName> \\\n  --name podsubnet \\\n  --address-prefixes <podSubnetPrefix> -o none\n\n# Create the AKS cluster\naz aks create \\\n  --name <clusterName> \\\n  --resource-group <resourceGroupName> \\\n  --location <location> \\\n  --max-pods 250 \\\n  --network-plugin azure \\\n  --vnet-subnet-id /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/nodesubnet \\\n  --pod-subnet-id /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/podsubnet \\\n  --network-dataplane cilium \\\n  --generate-ssh-keys\n```\n\n#### [Node Subnet](#tab/nodesubnet)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Azure CLI version 2.69.0 or later is required for this option.\n\n```azurecli\naz aks create \\\n  --name <clusterName> \\\n  --resource-group <resourceGroupName> \\\n  --location <location> \\\n  --network-plugin azure \\\n  --network-dataplane cilium \\\n  --generate-ssh-keys\n```\n\n---\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Migrating to Cilium may impact existing network policies. Review your policies and test thoroughly before deploying to production.\n\n### 3. Validate Supported Kubernetes and Cilium Versions\n\n| Kubernetes Version | Minimum Cilium Version |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1.27 (LTS)        | 1.13.18               |\n| 1.29              | 1.14.19               |\n| 1.31              | 1.16.6                |\n| 1.32              | 1.17.0                |\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> CiliumEndpointSlices require Kubernetes 1.32 or later. See [AKS supported versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions) for details.\n\n### 4. Configure CiliumEndpointSlices\n\nCiliumEndpointSlices enable scalable, dynamic grouping of pod endpoints for efficient service discovery and load balancing. In AKS, CiliumEndpointSlices are enabled by default when using Cilium as the network dataplane on supported Kubernetes versions.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> CiliumEndpointSlices do not support configuration of grouping parameters. Priority namespaces via `cilium.io/ces-namespace` are not supported in AKS.\n\nNo manual configuration is required for basic operation. To observe CiliumEndpointSlices:\n\n```azurecli\nkubectl get ciliumepslices -A\n```\n\nSample output:\n```output\nNAMESPACE   NAME                      AGE\nkube-system cilium-ces-1234567890     10m\n```\n\nTo view details:\n```azurecli\nkubectl describe ciliumepslice <slice-name> -n <namespace>\n```\n\n### 5. Enable Observability and Logging\n\nCilium integrates with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for enhanced observability. Enable monitoring during cluster creation or via the Azure Portal to collect metrics and logs related to network traffic, endpoint slice health, and policy enforcement.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Use Azure Monitor dashboards to visualize endpoint slice health, latency, and error rates for proactive troubleshooting.\n\n### 6. Best Practices and Troubleshooting\n\n- **Policy Compatibility**: Cilium enforces both Kubernetes and Cilium network policies. ipBlock rules do not apply to pod or node IPs\u2014use namespaceSelector or podSelector for pod-based rules.\n- **No Kube-Proxy**: AKS clusters with Cilium do not use kube-proxy. Service routing is handled by Cilium.\n- **Resource Management**: AKS does not set CPU or memory limits on the Cilium daemonset, as it is critical for networking.\n- **Fallback**: If Cilium fails, AKS reverts to the default endpoint management system.\n- **Security**: All communications are encrypted and integrated with Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Cilium is not supported for Windows node pools. Ensure all nodes are Linux-based.\n\n## Verification\n\nAfter deployment, verify that Cilium is running and managing network traffic:\n\n### 1. Check Cilium Pods\n\n```azurecli\nkubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=cilium\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```output\nNAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\ncilium-xxxxx   1/1     Running   0          5m\n```\n\n### 2. Confirm CiliumEndpointSlices\n\n```azurecli\nkubectl get ciliumepslices -A\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Network Policy Enforcement\n\nApply a sample network policy and verify traffic is allowed or denied as expected. For example:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: NetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: allow-all-egress\nspec:\n  podSelector: {}\n  policyTypes:\n  - Egress\n  egress:\n  - to:\n    - namespaceSelector: {}\n    - podSelector: {}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> ipBlock rules do not allow traffic to pod or node IPs in Cilium. Use selectors for pod-based rules.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Explore advanced Cilium features such as network policies and observability\n- Integrate Cilium with GitOps workflows as described in [Use GitOps with Flux v2 in AKS](tutorial-use-gitops-flux2.md)\n- Review [AKS release notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/release-notes) for updates to Cilium support\n- For more on AKS extensions, see [Secret Store CSI Driver integration](secret-store-extension.md)\n\n> [!div class=\"nextstepaction\"]\n> [Learn more about advanced networking in AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium)\n",
