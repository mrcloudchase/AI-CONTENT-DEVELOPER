This integration allows AKS to utilize Cilium's native network policy engine, providing granular security rules that align with enterprise compliance requirements.\n\n### Benefits of Using Cilium in AKS\n- **Enhanced Networking Efficiency**: Cilium enables dynamic grouping of service endpoints for rapid service discovery and efficient resource utilization.\n- **Improved Security & Policy Enforcement**: Utilize Cilium\u2019s rich network policy language to implement fine-grained security policies across dynamic endpoint slices.\n- **Optimized Developer & Operator Experience**: Provides a seamless configuration experience via Azure Portal, CLI, and APIs, reducing operational overhead and accelerating deployments.\n- **Operational Cost Efficiency**: Enhances the scalability and stability of clusters, reducing downtime and management costs, especially in large-scale deployments.\n\n### Architectural Overview\nCilium integrates with Azure CNI to provide a robust control plane combined with Cilium's data plane, utilizing eBPF programs loaded into the Linux kernel. This setup improves service routing, network policy enforcement, and cluster traffic observability. Cilium supports larger clusters with more nodes, pods, and services, offering IP Address Management (IPAM) with options for overlay networks or virtual networks.\n\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"./media/cilium-architecture.png\" alt-text=\"Cilium architecture in AKS\":::\n\nFor more detailed configuration steps, refer to the [How-To Guide on Cilium integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium).",
