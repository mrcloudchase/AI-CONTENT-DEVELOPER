        "updated": "## Architecture Overview\n\nThe architecture of Cilium integration with Azure CNI in AKS combines the robust control plane of Azure CNI with the data plane of Cilium. This integration leverages eBPF programs loaded into the Linux kernel to provide high-performance networking and security. Key architectural components include:\n\n- **Cilium Endpoint Slices**: Automatically manages pod endpoints into slices for faster lookup and improved scalability.\n- **Network Policy Enforcement**: Cilium\u2019s policy engine applies network security rules across all endpoint slices, supporting both ingress and egress policy enforcement.\n- **Observability**: Integrated with Azure Monitor and Cilium observability tools to provide detailed logging, metrics, and diagnostic information.\n- **IP Address Management (IPAM)**: Supports both overlay and virtual network models for assigning pod IPs, offering flexibility in network configuration.",
        "reason": "To provide an architectural overview that explains the integration of Cilium with Azure CNI in AKS, detailing how it enhances networking and security capabilities."
