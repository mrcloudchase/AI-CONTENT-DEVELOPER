    "thinking": "1. TOC structure understanding: The current TOC is organized by user journey: Overview, Quickstarts, Tutorials, Samples, Concepts, How-to guides, Reference, and Resources. How-to guides are subdivided by operational tasks (e.g., manage identity, manage your cluster, deploy services, troubleshooting). Networking-specific guidance is found under Concepts (Network requirements) and How-to guides (Simplify network connectivity). 2. Entry categorization: The new entry 'how-to-configure-cilium-aks.md' is a step-by-step operational guide focused on configuring Cilium in AKS with Azure CNI, targeting platform engineers. It is not conceptual (not a theory or background), nor a sample, but a practical, actionable guide. 3. Placement logic: How-to guides is the most appropriate parent section, as it contains practical, step-by-step instructions for operational tasks. Within How-to guides, there is a 'Simplify network connectivity' guide, but no dedicated networking sub-section or other CNI/Cilium content. Placing the new entry after 'Simplify network connectivity' keeps related network configuration topics together and maintains progressive complexity. 4. Final recommendations: Place 'how-to-configure-cilium-aks.md' immediately after 'Simplify network connectivity' in the How-to guides section. Consider creating a 'Networking' sub-section within How-to guides if more network-related how-tos are expected in the future.",

        "reasoning": "This placement groups the new Cilium/AKS configuration guide with existing network-related operational content, providing logical progression for users seeking to manage or enhance cluster networking. It matches the format and intent of other how-to guides and is discoverable for users looking for practical networking solutions."

      "Consider creating a 'Networking' sub-section within How-to guides to group all network-related operational guides, improving discoverability as more networking content is added.",

      "Review for other missing operational guides related to CNIs or advanced networking scenarios to further round out the How-to guides section."
