    "thinking": "1. TOC structure understanding: The current TOC is organized into high-level sections such as Overview, Quickstarts, Tutorials, Samples, Concepts, How-to guides, Reference, and Resources. Networking topics are currently under 'Concepts' (network requirements) and 'How-to guides' (simplify network connectivity). 2. Entry categorization: The new entry 'aks-cilium-networking-howto.md' is a practical, actionable guide focused on implementing and optimizing Cilium networking specifically in AKS, which is not covered in the existing docs. 3. Placement logic: Since this is a hands-on guide (not just conceptual), it fits best under 'How-to guides', specifically with other cluster/network management topics. It is more advanced than basic network requirements (Concepts), and more specific than the general 'Simplify network connectivity' guide. 4. Final recommendations: Place the new entry under 'How-to guides', ideally after 'Simplify network connectivity', and consider creating a dedicated networking subsection if more network-related how-tos are anticipated.",

Placing it after 'Simplify network connectivity' maintains a logical flow from general to specific networking solutions, and keeps related content together for user discoverability."

      "Create a dedicated 'Networking' subsection under 'How-to guides' if more network-related how-tos are added in the future.",

      "Review the overall balance of conceptual vs. how-to networking content to ensure users can easily find both high-level and hands-on guidance.",
      "Add displayName metadata to the new entry for improved searchability (e.g., cilium, aks, networking, azure cni)."
