    "thinking": "1. TOC structure understanding: The current TOC is organized by high-level categories such as Overview, Quickstarts, Tutorials, Concepts, How-to guides, Reference, and Resources. Networking-related content is primarily found under 'Concepts' (e.g., 'Network requirements') and 'How-to guides' (e.g., 'Simplify network connectivity').\n2. Entry categorization: The new entry 'aks-cilium-endpointslices-howto.md' is a specialized, actionable guide for platform engineers on integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI in AKS. It is not a conceptual overview but a practical, advanced how-to guide.\n3. Placement logic: The most relevant sections for actionable, technical guides are under 'How-to guides'. Within this, there is a 'Simplify network connectivity' guide and a general troubleshooting section, but nothing specific for advanced AKS networking scenarios like Cilium. Placing the new entry after 'Simplify network connectivity' keeps related networking content together and maintains a logical progression from general to advanced topics.\n4. Final recommendations: Place 'aks-cilium-endpointslices-howto.md' immediately after 'Simplify network connectivity' in the 'How-to guides' section. This aligns it with other network-related how-tos and ensures discoverability for users seeking advanced AKS networking guidance.",

        "reasoning": "This placement groups the advanced Cilium/AKS networking how-to with existing network-related guides, following the established pattern of actionable, scenario-driven documentation in the 'How-to guides' section. It ensures logical discoverability for platform engineers seeking network configuration guidance."

    "toc_suggestions": [
      "Consider creating a dedicated 'Networking' subsection under 'How-to guides' for better organization as more advanced network scenarios are added.",
      "Add cross-links between 'Concepts > Network requirements' and related how-to guides for improved navigation.",
      "Review the overall balance of 'Concepts' vs. 'How-to guides' to ensure advanced topics are easily discoverable and not buried among basic guides."
