    "thinking": "1. Materials review: I examined both the PRD and technical guide, noting their focus on integrating and configuring Cilium with Azure CNI in AKS, including networking, security, observability, and operational aspects. 2. Goal analysis: The stated goal is to document Cilium for AKS, which implies creating clear, actionable, and comprehensive documentation for users of AKS who want to leverage Cilium. 3. Intent determination: The materials and goal together indicate the intent is to inform and guide technical users on deploying, configuring, and understanding Cilium in the context of AKS, highlighting both requirements and implementation details. 4. Strategy formulation: The most effective approach is to produce a technical guide or documentation set that covers concepts, setup, configuration, feature support, limitations, and operational best practices for Cilium on AKS, tailored for Azure administrators and DevOps engineers.",
