    "thinking": "1. Materials review: I examined both the PRD and technical implementation guide, noting their focus on Cilium integration with AKS and Azure CNI, and the technical and business requirements they address. 2. Goal analysis: The stated goal is to document Cilium for AKS, which implies creating comprehensive, user-focused documentation that explains both the 'what' and 'how' of using Cilium in AKS environments. 3. Intent determination: Both materials emphasize not only technical configuration but also the rationale, benefits, and operational considerations of using Cilium with AKS. The documentation should therefore serve as both a conceptual overview and a practical guide. 4. Strategy formulation: The content should be structured as a technical guide or documentation set that covers architecture, features, configuration, use cases, and operational best practices for Cilium in AKS, targeting users who need to understand, deploy, and operate this integration.",
