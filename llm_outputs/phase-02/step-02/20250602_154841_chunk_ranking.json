    "thinking": "1. Goal understanding: The goal is to document Cilium for AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). This implies looking for documentation that covers Cilium (a CNI/networking solution) in the context of AKS. 2. Chunk evaluation criteria: Chunks that directly mention Cilium, AKS networking, or network requirements/configuration for AKS are most relevant. Chunks about general Arc, RBAC, GitOps, or unrelated topics are less relevant. 3. Relevance assessment: Assign higher scores to chunks with explicit AKS networking content, especially if they mention Cilium or AKS network plugins. Chunks about Arc connectivity, RBAC, or general management are less relevant. 4. Final ranking logic: Rank chunks by directness to AKS networking and Cilium, then by general AKS networking, then by peripheral relevance (Arc, RBAC, etc.).",
