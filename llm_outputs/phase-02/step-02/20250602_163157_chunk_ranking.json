    "thinking": "1. Goal understanding: The goal is to document Cilium for AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). This implies seeking content about Cilium (a CNI/networking plugin) in the context of AKS, or at least networking, connectivity, and AKS-specific guidance. 2. Chunk evaluation criteria: Chunks are evaluated for direct mention of Cilium, AKS, networking, or integration between Cilium and AKS. Secondary relevance is given to general AKS or Kubernetes networking documentation, especially if it mentions supported CNIs or network requirements. 3. Relevance assessment: Chunks mentioning AKS and networking, or integration with registries and AKS, are prioritized. Chunks only about Azure Arc or general Kubernetes management are less relevant unless they discuss networking or CNI. 4. Final ranking logic: Chunks are ranked highest if they mention AKS and networking, especially with Cilium or CNI context. Next are those with AKS and networking, then general AKS, then general Arc/Kubernetes management.",
