=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert at understanding documentation needs and intent.
You can analyze materials and goals to determine:
- What type of content is needed
- Target audience and their needs
- Key topics to cover
- Appropriate depth and style

CRITICAL: You MUST follow JSON type specifications exactly. Lists must be arrays, not strings.

Based on these materials and goal, what is the primary intent?

MATERIALS:
[{'thinking': "I began by thoroughly reading the entire document, identifying it as a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new AKS feature: support for CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium. I noted all explicit mentions of technologies, tools, and frameworks, including Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, Endpoint Slices, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, ARM templates, RBAC, and CI/CD. I extracted key concepts such as dynamic endpoint management, network policy enforcement, observability, scalability, reliability, security, usability, maintainability, and backward compatibility. For Microsoft/Azure products, I listed Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure CNI, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Portal, Azure Active Directory, and ARM templates. I validated each extraction by cross-referencing the content, ensuring no fabrication. I then synthesized a summary emphasizing the document's purpose (defining requirements for integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI in AKS), scope (business objectives, functional/non-functional requirements, user stories, dependencies, timeline), and technical value (enhanced networking, security, observability, and operational efficiency for AKS). Finally, I formatted all findings into the required JSON structure, ensuring type and content accuracy.", 'main_topic': 'CiliumEndpointSlices in AKS with Azure CNI', 'technologies': ['Cilium', 'Azure CNI', 'Kubernetes', 'CiliumEndpointSlices', 'Endpoint Slices', 'Azure Monitor', 'Log Analytics', 'ARM templates', 'RBAC', 'CI/CD'], 'key_concepts': ['dynamic endpoint management', 'advanced network policy enforcement', 'observability', 'scalability', 'reliability', 'security', 'usability', 'maintainability', 'backward compatibility', 'real-time synchronization', 'manual override', 'performance tuning', 'multi-cloud integration', 'predictive analytics'], 'microsoft_products': ['Azure Kubernetes Service', 'Azure CNI', 'Azure Monitor', 'Log Analytics', 'Azure Portal', 'Azure Active Directory', 'ARM templates'], 'document_type': 'Product Requirements Document', 'summary': 'This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium into Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The feature aims to enhance AKS networking by enabling dynamic endpoint grouping, advanced network policy enforcement, and improved observability through Azure Monitor and Cilium tools. It details business objectives such as networking efficiency, security, operational cost reduction, and competitive differentiation. The PRD specifies functional and non-functional requirements, including real-time endpoint management, policy enforcement, integration with Azure services, and robust fallback mechanisms. It also covers user scenarios, dependencies (e.g., on Cilium and Azure CNI), and a phased implementation timeline.

I identified the main topic as the integration and configuration of Cilium as the data plane for Azure CNI within AKS environments. I systematically extracted all explicitly mentioned technologies, including Azure CNI, Cilium, Kubernetes, eBPF, Azure CLI, and CiliumEndpointSlices. For key concepts, I noted network policy enforcement, IP address management (IPAM), overlay and virtual network modes, service routing, observability, and limitations such as lack of Windows support and ipBlock restrictions. I also extracted all Microsoft/Azure products referenced: Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CLI, Azure Virtual Network, Azure Resource Manager, and Azure Network Policy Manager. I verified each item was present in the source and avoided inferring or fabricating information. The summary was synthesized to reflect the document's purpose, scope, and technical value, focusing on deployment options, supported features, and operational considerations.
