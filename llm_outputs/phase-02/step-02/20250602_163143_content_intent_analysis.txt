=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert at understanding documentation needs and intent.
You can analyze materials and goals to determine:
- What type of content is needed
- Target audience and their needs
- Key topics to cover
- Appropriate depth and style

CRITICAL: You MUST follow JSON type specifications exactly. Lists must be arrays, not strings.

Based on these materials and goal, what is the primary intent?

MATERIALS:
[{'thinking': '1. I carefully read through the entire document to understand its structure, content, and technical focus. 2. I identified the document as a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new AKS networking feature. 3. I extracted all technologies, tools, and frameworks mentioned, including Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, Endpoint Slices, RBAC, and CI/CD. 4. I listed all key concepts such as dynamic endpoint management, advanced network policy enforcement, observability, scalability, and backward compatibility. 5. I identified all Microsoft/Azure products referenced, including Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CNI, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Portal, and Azure Active Directory. 6. I validated that each extracted item is explicitly mentioned in the source content. 7. I synthesized a comprehensive summary that covers the documentâ€™s purpose (defining requirements for integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI in AKS), its scope (functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, dependencies, timeline), and its technical value (enhanced networking, security, observability, and operational efficiency for AKS users). 8. I formatted all findings into the required JSON structure, ensuring all fields are present, correctly typed, and arrays contain only strings.', 'main_topic': 'CiliumEndpointSlices Integration in AKS', 'technologies': ['Cilium', 'Azure CNI', 'Kubernetes', 'CiliumEndpointSlices', 'Endpoint Slices', 'RBAC', 'CI/CD'], 'key_concepts': ['dynamic endpoint management', 'advanced network policy enforcement', 'service discovery', 'observability', 'configurability', 'scalability', 'security', 'operational cost efficiency', 'backward compatibility', 'real-time synchronization', 'manual override', 'audit logging', 'encryption', 'modular codebase', 'performance tuning', 'multi-cloud integration'], 'microsoft_products': ['Azure Kubernetes Service', 'Azure CNI', 'Azure Monitor', 'Log Analytics', 'Azure Portal', 'Azure Active Directory'], 'document_type': 'Product Requirements Document', 'summary': 'This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium into Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
