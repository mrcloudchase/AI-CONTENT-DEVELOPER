=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert at understanding documentation needs and intent.
You can analyze materials and goals to determine:
- What type of content is needed
- Target audience and their needs
- Key topics to cover
- Appropriate depth and style

CRITICAL: You MUST follow JSON type specifications exactly. Lists must be arrays, not strings.

MATERIALS:
[{'thinking': 'I began by thoroughly reading the entire PRD document, noting its structure and technical focus. The document is a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), specifically detailing the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium. I identified all technologies and frameworks explicitly mentioned: Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, CiliumEndpointSlices, Endpoint Slices, RBAC, CI/CD, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics. I then extracted all key concepts and methodologies, such as dynamic endpoint management, advanced network policy enforcement, observability, scalability, reliability, security, usability, maintainability, and backward compatibility. Next, I listed all Microsoft/Azure products referenced: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Azure Active Directory. I validated each extraction by cross-referencing with the source content. The document type is a Product Requirements Document, as it outlines business objectives, requirements, use cases, and a development timeline. Finally, I synthesized a comprehensive summary that encapsulates the document’s purpose, scope, and technical value, ensuring all fields are formatted per the specified JSON schema.', 'main_topic': 'CiliumEndpointSlices in AKS with Azure CNI', 'technologies': ['Cilium', 'Azure CNI', 'Kubernetes', 'CiliumEndpointSlices', 'Endpoint Slices', 'RBAC', 'CI/CD', 'Azure Monitor', 'Log Analytics'], 'key_concepts': ['dynamic endpoint management', 'advanced network policy enforcement', 'observability', 'scalability', 'reliability', 'security', 'usability', 'maintainability', 'backward compatibility', 'automatic configuration', 'real-time synchronization', 'manual override', 'audit logging', 'performance tuning', 'multi-cloud integration'], 'microsoft_products': ['Azure Kubernetes Service', 'Azure Portal', 'Azure CLI', 'Azure Resource Manager', 'Azure Monitor', 'Log Analytics', 'Azure Active Directory'], 'document_type': 'Product Requirements Document', 'summary': 'This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

I extracted key concepts including network policy enforcement, IP address management, overlay and virtual network modes, limitations, observability, and advanced container networking services. I cataloged all Microsoft and Azure products mentioned, such as Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure CLI, Azure Resource Manager, and Azure Virtual Network. I validated each extracted item against the source to ensure accuracy and avoided inferring any information not directly stated.
