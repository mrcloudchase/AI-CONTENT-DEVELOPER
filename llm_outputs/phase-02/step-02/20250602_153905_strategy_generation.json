    "thinking": "I began by analyzing the user materials, which focus on Cilium integration with AKS, specifically around CiliumEndpointSlices, Azure CNI, and advanced networking features. The PRD (Material 1) provides business and technical requirements, while the Microsoft Learn guide (Material 2) offers a technical walkthrough for deploying Azure CNI powered by Cilium. Next, I reviewed the existing content and its relevance. The most relevant files are Azure Arc-related tutorials and concept articles, which cover GitOps, network requirements, and connectivity modes for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes but do not address Cilium for AKS directly. There is no existing content in the provided set that documents Cilium integration for AKS, CiliumEndpointSlices, or the specific configuration and operational guidance required for platform engineers using AKS. The content types in the repository are mostly tutorials and concept articles for Azure Arc, with no how-to or overview content for Cilium on AKS. Coverage for the target topic is therefore <30% (low), and the content type needed (How-To Guide for Cilium on AKS) does not exist. This justifies a CREATE action. The most appropriate content type is a How-To Guide, as platform engineers will need step-by-step instructions for deploying, configuring, and managing Cilium in AKS, including advanced features like endpoint slices and integration with Azure Monitor. I referenced the most relevant chunk_ids (from the Azure Arc network requirements and GitOps tutorials) to provide context for related networking and operational practices, but the new content will be independent and focused on AKS+Cilium. No UPDATE actions are warranted, as there is no overlapping content to extend.",
