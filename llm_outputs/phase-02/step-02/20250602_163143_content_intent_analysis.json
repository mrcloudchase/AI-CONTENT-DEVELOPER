    "thinking": "1. Materials review: I examined two documents\u2014a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for integrating CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI in AKS, and a technical implementation guide for configuring Azure CNI powered by Cilium in AKS. 2. Goal analysis: The stated goal is to document Cilium for AKS, suggesting a need for comprehensive, accurate, and accessible documentation covering both the requirements and implementation aspects. 3. Intent determination: Both materials focus on explaining, specifying, and guiding the integration and configuration of Cilium in AKS, highlighting networking, security, and operational improvements. 4. Strategy formulation: The primary intent is to create documentation that enables AKS users (operators, administrators, developers, security engineers) to understand, deploy, and manage Cilium-based networking in AKS, covering both conceptual and practical aspects.",
    "primary_intent": "To provide clear, comprehensive documentation that explains the integration, configuration, and benefits of using Cilium with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), enabling users to understand, deploy, and manage advanced networking features.",
    "content_type": "Comprehensive technical documentation (conceptual overview, requirements, and implementation guide)",
    "target_audience": "AKS administrators, cluster operators, network engineers, security engineers, and developers working with Kubernetes on Azure",
    "key_objectives": [
      "Explain the purpose and value of integrating Cilium with AKS",
      "Detail the requirements and supported scenarios for Cilium in AKS",
      "Provide step-by-step guidance for configuring and managing Cilium networking in AKS",
      "Describe key features such as network policy enforcement, observability, scalability, and security",
      "Highlight limitations, prerequisites, and troubleshooting steps",
      "Ensure users can make informed decisions about deploying and operating Cilium in AKS"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Users can successfully deploy and configure Cilium in AKS following the documentation",
      "Documentation addresses both conceptual and practical user needs",
      "Key features, requirements, and limitations are clearly described and understood",
      "Positive feedback from target audience (e.g., reduced support requests, increased adoption)",
      "Documentation is kept up-to-date with AKS and Cilium releases"
