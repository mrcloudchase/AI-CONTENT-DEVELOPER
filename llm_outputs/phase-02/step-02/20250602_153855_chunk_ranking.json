    "thinking": "1. Goal understanding: The goal is to document Cilium for AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). This means looking for content about Cilium, AKS, and their integration, especially networking, network policies, and related requirements. 2. Chunk evaluation criteria: Chunks are evaluated for direct mention of Cilium, AKS, networking, network policies, or relevant configuration steps. Chunks about Azure Arc, general Kubernetes, or other unrelated topics are less relevant unless they specifically reference AKS networking. 3. Relevance assessment: Chunks are scored higher if they mention AKS networking, Cilium, or network requirements/configuration for AKS. Chunks about general Azure Arc features, RBAC, or GitOps are less relevant. 4. Final ranking logic: Chunks are ranked by directness to the goal (Cilium on AKS), then by networking requirements for AKS, then by AKS-specific configuration, then by general Kubernetes or Azure Arc information.",
