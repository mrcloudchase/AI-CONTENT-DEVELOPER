=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert at understanding documentation needs and intent.
You can analyze materials and goals to determine:
- What type of content is needed
- Target audience and their needs
- Key topics to cover
- Appropriate depth and style

CRITICAL: You MUST follow JSON type specifications exactly. Lists must be arrays, not strings.

Based on these materials and goal, what is the primary intent?

MATERIALS:
[{'thinking': '1. I thoroughly read the entire document, noting its structure as a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 2. I identified the main topic as the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium, aimed at enhancing AKS networking. 3. I extracted all technologies and tools explicitly mentioned: Cilium, Azure CNI, Kubernetes, CiliumEndpointSlices, Endpoint Slices, RBAC, CI/CD, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and ARM templates. 4. I listed key concepts such as dynamic endpoint management, advanced network policy enforcement, observability, scalability, security, backward compatibility, and integration with Azure services. 5. I cataloged all Microsoft/Azure products referenced: Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Portal, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Active Directory, Azure Resource Manager (ARM templates), and Azure infrastructure components. 6. I validated that each extracted item is present in the source. 7. I synthesized a summary covering the documentâ€™s purpose (defining requirements for the new feature), its scope (functional, non-functional, business rationale, user scenarios, dependencies, and timeline), and its technical value (enhanced networking, security, observability, and operational efficiency for AKS). 8. I structured all findings into the required JSON format, ensuring all type and content requirements are strictly met.', 'main_topic': 'CiliumEndpointSlices Integration in AKS', 'technologies': ['Cilium', 'Azure CNI', 'Kubernetes', 'CiliumEndpointSlices', 'Endpoint Slices', 'RBAC', 'CI/CD', 'Azure Monitor', 'Log Analytics', 'ARM templates'], 'key_concepts': ['dynamic endpoint management', 'advanced network policy enforcement', 'observability', 'scalability', 'security', 'backward compatibility', 'feature configurability', 'performance optimization', 'integration with Azure services', 'real-time synchronization', 'manual override', 'audit logging', 'modular codebase', 'predictive analytics', 'multi-cloud integration', 'user experience enhancement'], 'microsoft_products': ['Azure Kubernetes Service', 'Azure Portal', 'Azure Monitor', 'Log Analytics', 'Azure Active Directory', 'Azure Resource Manager', 'Azure infrastructure'], 'document_type': 'Product Requirements Document', 'summary': 'This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
