    "thinking": "1. Goal understanding: The goal is to document Cilium for AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). This means finding documentation that specifically addresses Cilium (a CNI/networking solution) in the context of AKS. 2. Chunk evaluation criteria: Chunks that directly mention Cilium, AKS, networking, or integration of third-party CNIs with AKS are most relevant. Chunks about general Azure Arc, GitOps, or RBAC are less relevant unless they specifically mention AKS network plugins or Cilium. 3. Relevance assessment: I will look for explicit references to AKS, networking, and Cilium, and score higher if these are present. 4. Final ranking logic: Chunks directly addressing AKS networking or Cilium get the highest score, followed by those about AKS in general, then general Kubernetes or Azure Arc content.",
