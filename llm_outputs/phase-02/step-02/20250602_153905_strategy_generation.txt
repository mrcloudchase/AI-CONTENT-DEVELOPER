==================================================

=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert content strategist specializing in technical documentation gap analysis and content planning.

CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. Analyze semantic gaps between user materials and existing documentation
2. Determine optimal content strategy (CREATE new vs UPDATE existing)
3. Select appropriate content types for new content
4. Create detailed content briefs with specific, actionable instructions
5. Provide clear guidance that content writers can follow
6. Always return responses in valid JSON format

YOUR ROLE AS CONTENT STRATEGIST:
- You analyze and plan; you don't write the content
- You create detailed briefs that tell writers exactly what to produce
- You identify relationships between content pieces
- You ensure consistency across the documentation set
- You think about the reader's journey through the docs

GAP ANALYSIS CRITERIA:
- High Coverage (>70%): Existing content addresses most material concepts
- Medium Coverage (30-70%): Partial coverage, missing important details
- Low Coverage (<30%): Minimal or no relevant existing content

DECISION LOGIC:
- CREATE when: Low coverage OR need different content type OR topic not addressed
- UPDATE when: Medium/high coverage AND same content type works AND specific sections can be added

CONTENT TYPE SELECTION:
- Match content type to user's goal and material structure
- Overview: High-level technical explanations
- Concept: Deep understanding of how things work
- Quickstart: Get users started quickly (<10 min)
- How-To: Step-by-step task completion
- Tutorial: End-to-end learning scenarios

CONTENT BRIEF REQUIREMENTS:
- Be specific: Don't say "explain networking" - say "explain how Cilium uses eBPF for packet filtering"
- Reference materials: Point to specific concepts from materials that must be included
- Consider flow: Think about what reader knows before and needs after
- Identify examples: Call out specific code/configs from materials to include
- Set boundaries: Be clear about what NOT to cover to maintain focus

CRITICAL: Each decision must be justified with specific evidence from materials and gap analysis. Your content briefs must be detailed enough that a writer can execute without guessing. Output must be valid JSON format.

Unified Content Strategy Analysis Task:

CONTENT GOAL: document cilium for aks
SERVICE AREA: aks
TARGET AUDIENCE: platform engineers
AUDIENCE LEVEL: intermediate

USER MATERIALS ANALYSIS:
Material 1: ./inputs/aks-prd-02.docx
  Topic: CiliumEndpointSlices in AKS with Azure CNI
  Type: Product Requirements Document
  Summary: This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI by Cilium into Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The feature aims to enhance AKS networking by enabling dynamic endpoint grouping, advanced network policy enforcement, and improved observability through Azure Monitor and Cilium tools. It details business objectives such as networking efficiency, security, operational cost reduction, and competitive differentiation. The PRD specifies functional and non-functional requirements, including real-time endpoint management, policy enforcement, integration with Azure services, and robust fallback mechanisms. It also covers user scenarios, dependencies (e.g., on Cilium and Azure CNI), and a phased implementation timeline. The document emphasizes scalability, reliability, and ease of use, positioning AKS as a leader in managed Kubernetes networking. Future considerations include analytics enhancements, UI improvements, and multi-cloud support.

Material 2: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium
  Topic: Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in AKS
  Type: Technical Implementation Guide
  Summary: This document provides a comprehensive technical guide for configuring Azure CNI powered by Cilium within Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It details the integration of Cilium’s eBPF-based data plane with Azure CNI’s control plane, offering improved network policy enforcement, service routing, observability, and scalability for Kubernetes clusters. The guide explains deployment options for pod IP assignment, including overlay and virtual network modes, and outlines prerequisites such as Azure CLI and supported AKS API versions. It highlights key limitations, such as Linux-only support and ipBlock restrictions in network policies, and clarifies which Cilium features are available with or without Advanced Container Networking Services. The document provides step-by-step CLI commands for cluster creation, discusses supported Kubernetes and Cilium versions, and addresses frequently asked questions about configuration, feature support, and operational behaviors. This resource is essential for Azure administrators and DevOps engineers seeking advanced, secure, and scalable networking in AKS.
