COVERAGE SUMMARY: 6 topics, 10 total chunks

AVAILABLE CONTENT TYPES:
- **Overview** (ms.topic: overview)
  Purpose: For new customers. To explain the service, technology, or functionality from a technical point of view. It isn't intended to define benefits or value prop; that would be in marketing content.
  Use when: An article explaining the service from a technical point of view. And/or an article comparing features across related services/projects.
- **Concept** (ms.topic: concept-article)
  Purpose: When you want to: - explain what something is and define its critical functions - describe how something works or what happens when something is done - provide guidelines for completing a job task in varied situations.
  Use when: In-depth explanation of functionality related to a service(s) that are fundamental to understanding and use.
- **Quickstart** (ms.topic: quickstart)
  Purpose: When you can get the service, technology, or functionality into the hands of new customers in less than 10 minutes. Quickstarts are preferred, but not required if no meaningful functionality can be introduced to new users in under 10 minutes.
  Use when: Fundamental day-1 instructions for new customers to quickly try out a specific product/service. The focus is on getting the product/service into the hands of customers so they can use it in their production environment.
- **How-To Guide** (ms.topic: how-to)
  Purpose: To provide the steps for completing a task. To help customers complete tasks in their own environment. How-to guides differ from tutorials in that they can include optional information, explanations, and information to help inform decisions.
  Use when: Procedural articles that show the customer how to complete a task.
- **Tutorial** (ms.topic: tutorial)
  Purpose: To show the single best procedure for completing a customer task.
  Use when: Scenario-based procedures for top customer tasks. The focus is on showing the customer how to do the task, not on helping them set up their own environment.

TASK: Perform comprehensive gap analysis and generate content strategy with specific actions.

AUDIENCE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Target readers: platform engineers
- Technical depth: intermediate level
- Beginner: Include prerequisites, detailed explanations, basic concepts
- Intermediate: Balance explanation with technical detail
- Advanced: Focus on implementation, optimization, and edge cases

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. GAP ANALYSIS: Compare user materials against existing content considering:
   - Content type mismatches (need how-to but only have overview)
   - Coverage depth (surface mention vs comprehensive coverage)
   - Missing features or concepts from materials
   
2. DECISION FRAMEWORK:
   - If coverage < 30% OR wrong content type exists → CREATE new content
   - If coverage 30-70% AND same content type needed → UPDATE with additions
   - If coverage > 70% but missing key details → UPDATE with specific sections
   
3. FOR CREATE ACTIONS:
   - Select appropriate content type based on user materials and goal
   - Reference specific chunk_ids from TOP RELEVANT CHUNKS section
   - Specify exact filename and comprehensive reason
   - Create detailed content_brief with:
     * Clear objective stating what reader will accomplish
     * Specific topics from materials that must be covered
     * Prerequisites based on existing content analysis
     * Related docs from the repository to reference
     * Logical next steps based on content progression
     * Technical depth guidance based on audience level
     * Specific examples from materials to include
   
4. FOR UPDATE ACTIONS:
   - Identify current content type from ms.topic
   - Specify exact sections/information to add
   - Reference specific chunk_ids that show where to add content
   - Provide specific change description
   - Create detailed content_brief with:
     * Update objective explaining the gap being filled
     * Specific sections to add with placement guidance
     * Sections to modify with clear preservation instructions
     * New examples from materials to incorporate
     * Additional links to connect updated content
     * Style consistency requirements

5. RELEVANT CHUNKS: Use ONLY chunk_ids from the provided TOP RELEVANT CHUNKS or from file's relevant_chunks
