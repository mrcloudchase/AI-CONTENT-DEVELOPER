    "thinking": "The user materials focus on Cilium integration with Azure CNI in AKS, specifically covering CiliumEndpointSlices and the technical setup of Azure CNI powered by Cilium. The existing content set is heavily weighted toward Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes, GitOps, Secret Store, and Open Service Mesh, with high coverage in those areas, but there is no direct coverage of Cilium or its integration with AKS or Azure CNI. No content chunk or file addresses Cilium, CiliumEndpointSlices, or the specifics of Azure CNI powered by Cilium in AKS. The content types present (concept, how-to, tutorial) do not include a how-to guide or overview for Cilium in AKS. Given the lack of any direct coverage (<30%) and the absence of the required content type, a new how-to guide is necessary. The guide should be targeted at intermediate platform engineers, focusing on practical setup and configuration, referencing the technical implementation guide and PRD from user materials. The guide should include prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, best practices, and troubleshooting, with code/configuration examples. It should also reference related concepts in existing docs, such as agent upgrades and YAML editing, for continuity in the reader journey.",
