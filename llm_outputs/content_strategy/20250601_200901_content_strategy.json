    "thinking": "The current documentation for Cilium integration in AKS is well-covered in existing content, particularly in the 'network-requirements.md' file. However, the user materials indicate a need for more practical, task-oriented documentation, such as a How-To Guide, to assist platform engineers in configuring and managing Cilium with Azure CNI in AKS. The existing content is largely conceptual and does not provide step-by-step guidance for practical implementation. This gap suggests the need to create a new How-To Guide to address the practical configuration and management aspects of Cilium in AKS.",
