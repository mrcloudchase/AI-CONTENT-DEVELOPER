    "thinking": "The user materials focus on Cilium integration with Azure CNI in AKS, including technical configuration, eBPF-based data plane, and CiliumEndpointSlices. The existing documentation set is highly focused on Azure Arc, secret management, GitOps with Flux, and agent upgrades, but does not address Cilium in AKS at all. None of the top relevant chunks or content clusters mention Cilium, Azure CNI powered by Cilium, or AKS networking enhancements. There is a complete topical gap: no overview, how-to, or concept content exists for Cilium in AKS. This is a low coverage (<30%) scenario. The correct action is to CREATE new content. The optimal content type is a How-To Guide, as the user materials are technical guides and PRDs detailing configuration and integration steps. The guide should provide actionable steps for configuring and using Cilium with Azure CNI in AKS, aimed at intermediate technical professionals. Prerequisites should reference existing AKS and Kubernetes setup docs, but not Arc, Flux, or secret store content, as these are unrelated. The brief must include eBPF, CiliumEndpointSlices, and integration steps, with code/config examples from the user materials. Warnings should address security and compatibility. No UPDATE actions are needed, as there is no overlapping content.",
