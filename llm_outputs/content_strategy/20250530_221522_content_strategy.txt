Unified Content Strategy Analysis Task:

CONTENT GOAL: guidance on using cilium with aks
SERVICE AREA: aks

USER MATERIALS ANALYSIS:
• Cilium Integration with AKS: This Product Requirement Document (PRD) outlines the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices with Azure CNI in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to enhance networking capabilities. It details business object
• Azure CNI Cilium Integration: This document serves as a comprehensive guide for configuring Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It outlines the integration of Azure CNI's control plane with Cilium's data

EXISTING CONTENT ANALYSIS:

File: azure-cni-powered-by-cilium.md
Content Type: How-To Guide (ms.topic: how-to)
Relevance: 0.86 - High coverage - existing content addresses most concepts
Matched Sections: Configure Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) > Considerations, Configure Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) > Network Policy Enforcement, Configure Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) > Prerequisites

AVAILABLE CONTENT TYPES:
- **Overview** (ms.topic: overview)
  Purpose: For new customers. To explain the service, technology, or functionality from a technical point of view. It isn't intended to define benefits or value prop; that would be in marketing content.
  Use when: An article explaining the service from a technical point of view. And/or an article comparing features across related services/projects.
- **Concept** (ms.topic: concept-article)
  Purpose: When you want to: - explain what something is and define its critical functions - describe how something works or what happens when something is done - provide guidelines for completing a job task in varied situations.
  Use when: In-depth explanation of functionality related to a service(s) that are fundamental to understanding and use.
- **Quickstart** (ms.topic: quickstart)
  Purpose: When you can get the service, technology, or functionality into the hands of new customers in less than 10 minutes. Quickstarts are preferred, but not required if no meaningful functionality can be introduced to new users in under 10 minutes.
  Use when: Fundamental day-1 instructions for new customers to quickly try out a specific product/service. The focus is on getting the product/service into the hands of customers so they can use it in their production environment.
- **How-To Guide** (ms.topic: how-to)
  Purpose: To provide the steps for completing a task. To help customers complete tasks in their own environment. How-to guides differ from tutorials in that they can include optional information, explanations, and information to help inform decisions.
  Use when: Procedural articles that show the customer how to complete a task.
- **Tutorial** (ms.topic: tutorial)
  Purpose: To show the single best procedure for completing a customer task.
  Use when: Scenario-based procedures for top customer tasks. The focus is on showing the customer how to do the task, not on helping them set up their own environment.

TASK: Perform comprehensive gap analysis and generate content strategy with specific actions.

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. GAP ANALYSIS: Compare user materials against existing content considering:
   - Content type mismatches (need how-to but only have overview)
   - Coverage depth (surface mention vs comprehensive coverage)
   - Missing features or concepts from materials
   
2. DECISION FRAMEWORK:
   - If coverage < 30% OR wrong content type exists → CREATE new content
   - If coverage 30-70% AND same content type needed → UPDATE with additions
   - If coverage > 70% but missing key details → UPDATE with specific sections
   
3. FOR CREATE ACTIONS:
   - Select appropriate content type based on user materials and goal
   - Identify 3-5 most relevant existing chunks as reference material
   - Specify exact filename and comprehensive reason
   
4. FOR UPDATE ACTIONS:
   - Identify current content type from ms.topic
   - Specify exact sections/information to add
   - Identify relevant chunks showing current content
   - Provide specific change description

5. RELEVANT CHUNKS: For each action, include chunks that will help content generation
