The existing documentation, 'azure-cni-powered-by-cilium.md', is a How-To Guide with high coverage (0.86) on configuring Azure CNI powered by Cilium in AKS. However, it lacks specific details on the integration of CiliumEndpointSlices and the broader architectural overview of Cilium within AKS. The gap analysis indicates a need to create a new Concept article to provide a deeper understanding of Cilium's integration with AKS, and an update to the existing How-To Guide to include missing details about CiliumEndpointSlices.",
