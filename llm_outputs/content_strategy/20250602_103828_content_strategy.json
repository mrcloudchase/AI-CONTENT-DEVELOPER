    "thinking": "The user materials focus on the integration of Cilium (specifically CiliumEndpointSlices and Azure CNI powered by Cilium) into Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), targeting technical professionals at an intermediate level. The existing documentation set, while comprehensive for Arc-enabled Kubernetes extensions, secrets management, and GitOps with Flux, does not directly address Cilium integration with AKS networking. There are no files or chunks that cover Cilium concepts, architecture, configuration, or operational guidance within AKS. The closest matches (high relevance) are about unrelated extensions (Secret Store, Flux, AKV Secrets Provider) and do not mention Cilium or AKS networking plugins. This represents a low coverage (<30%) for the topic of 'document Cilium for AKS.' There is also a content type gap: no How-To Guide or Concept article exists for configuring or understanding Cilium in AKS. Therefore, a new How-To Guide is required to address the step-by-step process of enabling and configuring Cilium in AKS, referencing the integration details from the user materials. The guide should be actionable, with configuration steps, code examples, best practices, and warnings, tailored to intermediate users. No updates to existing files are appropriate, as none address the Cilium topic.",
