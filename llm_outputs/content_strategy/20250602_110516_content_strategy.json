    "thinking": "The user materials focus on CiliumEndpointSlices integration and Azure CNI powered by Cilium in AKS, targeting platform engineers at an intermediate level. Existing documentation covers Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes, GitOps with Flux, Secret Store, and OSM, but does not address Cilium or its integration with AKS or Azure CNI. There are no overview, concept, how-to, or tutorial articles about Cilium in AKS, nor any mention of CiliumEndpointSlices or Azure CNI powered by Cilium. This is a significant semantic and topical gap (<30% coverage) as none of the top relevant chunks or content clusters address Cilium in the context of AKS. The correct content type for the primary gap is a How-To Guide, as platform engineers will expect actionable, step-by-step instructions for deploying, configuring, and validating Cilium in AKS, as well as understanding its integration with Azure CNI and CiliumEndpointSlices. A secondary need (not covered here due to the primary gap) would be a Concept or Overview article. The decision is to CREATE a new How-To Guide focused on deploying and configuring Cilium with Azure CNI in AKS, referencing the user materials for technical depth and including configuration and validation steps. No UPDATE actions are warranted as no existing content addresses this topic.",
