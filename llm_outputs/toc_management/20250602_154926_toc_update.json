    "thinking": "The new file 'how-to-configure-cilium-aks.md' is a how-to guide. Based on the file name, it describes how to configure Cilium (a CNI/networking solution) on AKS clusters. In the current TOC, the 'How-to guides' section contains procedural content for managing, deploying, and configuring various features on Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters. There is also a 'Simplify network connectivity' guide and other network-related topics in 'Concepts' (e.g., 'Network requirements'), but those are conceptual, not procedural. Since this is a how-to guide and is about configuring networking, the most logical and discoverable placement is under 'How-to guides', ideally after or near other network-related guides. There is only one directly network-related how-to ('Simplify network connectivity'), so I will place 'Configure Cilium on AKS clusters' immediately after it for logical grouping and discoverability. All other entries are preserved exactly as they are, and the new entry is formatted with a clear, concise, and action-oriented display name.",
