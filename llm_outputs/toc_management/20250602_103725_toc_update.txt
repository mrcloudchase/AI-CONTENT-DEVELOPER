=== NEWLY CREATED FILES (Need TOC entries) ===

File: aks-cilium-networking-howto.md
Content Type: How-To Guide
Purpose: There is no existing documentation covering Cilium integration with Azure CNI in AKS. The current content set focuses on Arc, secret management, and GitOps, with no mention of Cilium, eBPF, or AKS networking enhancements. User materials provide detailed technical and configuration information that is not represented in the docs. A new How-To Guide is needed to fill this critical gap for technical professionals deploying and configuring Cilium in AKS.
Objective: Guide the reader through configuring and using Azure CNI powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), including enabling CiliumEndpointSlices and leveraging eBPF for advanced networking.



TASK: Create a complete updated TOC.yml file that includes all existing entries PLUS the new entries for the missing files. The output should be the ENTIRE TOC.yml content that can be written directly to replace the current file.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Return the COMPLETE TOC.yml file content (not just new entries)
2. Preserve ALL existing TOC entries exactly as they are
3. Add new entries in appropriate locations based on content type and topic
4. Use proper YAML formatting with correct indentation
5. Ensure all file paths are relative and correct
6. Add meaningful display names that match the document titles
7. Group related content together logically
8. Maintain alphabetical or logical ordering within sections

TOC ENTRY FORMAT:
- name: Display Name
  href: relative/path/to/file.md
  items: # Optional, for nested structure
    - name: Nested Item
      href: path/to/nested.md

PLACEMENT GUIDELINES:
- How-to guides: Place with other procedural content
- Concepts: Group with architectural/conceptual docs
- Quickstarts: Place at the beginning of relevant sections
- Tutorials: Group with learning materials
- Overview: Typically first in a section

IMPORTANT: Return the ENTIRE updated TOC.yml file content, not just the sections with changes. The 'content' field should contain the complete TOC.yml that will replace the existing file.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "thinking": "Explain your reasoning for placement decisions and how you're maintaining the structure",
  "content": "<COMPLETE updated TOC.yml content from first line to last line>",
  "entries_added": ["file1.md", "file2.md"],
  "entries_verified": ["existing1.md", "existing2.md"],
  "placement_decisions": {
    "file1.md": "Placed under 'Getting Started' because it's a quickstart guide",
    "file2.md": "Added to 'Configuration' section with other how-to guides"
  }
}
