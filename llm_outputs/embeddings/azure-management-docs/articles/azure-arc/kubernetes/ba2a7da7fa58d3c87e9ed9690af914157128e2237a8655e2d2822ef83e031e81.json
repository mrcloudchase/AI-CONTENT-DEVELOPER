You can also [import this dashboard to any Grafana instance](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/import-dashboards/). With this option, a service principal must be used; managed identity is not supported for data connection outside of Azure Managed Grafana.\n\n1. Create an Azure Managed Grafana instance by using the [Azure portal](/azure/managed-grafana/quickstart-managed-grafana-portal) or [Azure CLI](/azure/managed-grafana/quickstart-managed-grafana-cli). Ensure that you're able to access Grafana by selecting its endpoint on the Overview page. You need at least **Grafana Editor** level permissions to view and edit dashboards. You can check your access by going to **Access control (IAM)** on the Grafana instance.  \n1. If you're using a managed identity for the Azure Managed Grafana instance, follow these steps to assign it the **Monitoring Reader** role on the subscription where you created your Azure Managed Grafana instance:\n\n   1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the subscription that you want to add.\n   1. Select **Access control (IAM)**.\n   1. Select **Add role assignment**.\n   1. Select the **Monitoring Reader** role, then select **Next**.\n   1. On the **Members** tab, select **Managed identity**, then choose **Select members**.\n   1. From the **Managed identity** list, select the subscription, then select **Azure Managed Grafana** and the name of your Azure Managed Grafana instance.\n   1. Select **Review + assign**.\n\n   If you're using a service principal, grant the **Monitoring Reader** role to the service principal that you'll use for your data source connection. Follow these same steps, but change the **Assign access to** selection to **User, group, or service principal**. Then choose **Select members** and select your service principal. (If you're using a Grafana instance outside of  Azure Managed Grafana, you must use a service principal for data connection access.)",
