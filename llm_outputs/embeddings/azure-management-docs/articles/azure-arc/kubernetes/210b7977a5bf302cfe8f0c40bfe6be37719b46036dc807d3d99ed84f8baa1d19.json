Refer to the [conceptual article](conceptual-workload-management.md) exploring the business process, challenges and solution architecture.\n\nThis article walks you through an example scenario of the workload deployment and configuration in a multi-cluster Kubernetes environment.

Next, you work through a set of use cases where you act as different personas working in the same environment: the Platform Team and the Application Team.",
