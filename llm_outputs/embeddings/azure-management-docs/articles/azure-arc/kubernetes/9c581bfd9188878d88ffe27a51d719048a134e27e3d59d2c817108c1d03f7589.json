With the increasing diversity of Kubernetes cluster types, and the variety of applications and services, the process can become complex and unscalable. Enterprise organizations can be more successful in these efforts by having a well defined structure that organizes people and their activities, and by using automated tools.\n\nThis article walks you through a typical business scenario, outlining the involved personas and major challenges that organizations often face while managing cloud-native workloads in a multi-cluster environment. It also suggests an architectural pattern that can make this complex process simpler, observable, and more scalable.",
