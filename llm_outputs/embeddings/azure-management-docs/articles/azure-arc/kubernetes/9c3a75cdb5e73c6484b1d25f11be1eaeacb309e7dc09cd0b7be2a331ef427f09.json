    "content": "### Optional parameters for an update\n\n| Parameter name | Description |\n|--------------|------------|\n| `--auto-upgrade-minor-version` | A Boolean property that specifies whether the extension minor version is automatically upgraded. The default setting is `true`. If this parameter is set to `true`, you can't set the `version` parameter because the version is dynamically updated. If the parameter is set to `false`, the extension isn't automatically upgraded, even for patch versions. |\n| `--version` | The version of the extension to be installed (a specific version to pin the extension instance to). Must not be supplied if `auto-upgrade-minor-version` is set to `true`. |\n| `--configuration-settings` | Settings that can be passed into the extension to control its functionality. These settings are passed in as space-separated `key=value` pairs after the parameter name. If the parameter is used in the command, `--configuration-settings-file` can't be used in the same command. Only the settings that require an update need to be provided. The provided settings are replaced with the specified values. |\n| `--configuration-settings-file` | The path to a JSON file that contains `key=value` pairs to be used for passing in configuration settings to the extension. If this parameter is used in the command, you can't use `--configuration-settings` in the same command. |\n| `--configuration-protected-settings` | Settings that aren't retrievable by using `GET` API calls or `az k8s-extension show` commands. Typically used to pass in sensitive settings. These settings are passed in as space-separated `key=value` pairs after the parameter name. If this parameter is used in the command, the `--configuration-protected-settings-file` can't be used in the same command. When you update a protected setting, configure all protected settings. If any of the settings are omitted, those settings are considered obsolete, and they're deleted.  |\n| `--configuration-protected-settings-file` | The path to a JSON file that contains `key=value` pairs to be used for passing in sensitive settings to the extension. If this parameter is used in the command, you can't use `--configuration-protected-settings` in the same command. |\n| `--scope` | The scope of installation for the extension. Use either `cluster` or `namespace`. |\n| `--release-train` | The author of an extension can publish versions in different release trains, such as `Stable` or `Preview`. If this parameter isn't set explicitly, `Stable` is the default.  |",
