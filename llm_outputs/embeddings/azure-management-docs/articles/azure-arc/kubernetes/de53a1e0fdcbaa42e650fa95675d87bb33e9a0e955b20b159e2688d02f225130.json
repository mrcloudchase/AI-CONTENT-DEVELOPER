These lookup commands should return private IP addresses in your Azure virtual network. If they resolve public IP addresses, double check your server and network's DNS configuration.\n\n  ```console\n  nslookup gbl.his.arc.azure.com\n  nslookup agentserviceapi.guestconfiguration.azure.com\n  nslookup dp.kubernetesconfiguration.azure.com\n  ```\n\n* For issues onboarding your Kubernetes cluster, confirm that you added the Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Resource Manager, AzureFrontDoor.FirstParty, and Microsoft Container Registry service tags to your local network firewall.\n\nFor more troubleshooting tips, see [Troubleshoot Azure Private Endpoint connectivity problems](/azure/private-link/troubleshoot-private-endpoint-connectivity).",
