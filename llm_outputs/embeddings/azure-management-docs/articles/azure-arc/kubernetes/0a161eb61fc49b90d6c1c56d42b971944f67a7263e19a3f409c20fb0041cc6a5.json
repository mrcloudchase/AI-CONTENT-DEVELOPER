In Azure Marketplace, you can find, try, buy, and deploy the software and services that you need to build new solutions and manage your cloud infrastructure. The catalog includes solutions for different industries and technical areas, free trials, and consulting services from Microsoft partners.\n\nIncluded among these solutions are Kubernetes application-based container offers. These offers contain applications that can run on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, represented as [cluster extensions](conceptual-extensions.md). Deploying an offer from Azure Marketplace creates a new instance of the extension on your Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThis article shows you how to:\n\n- Discover applications that support Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters.\n- Purchase an application.\n- Deploy the application on your cluster.\n- Monitor usage and billing information.\n\nYou can use Azure CLI or the Azure portal to perform these tasks.",
