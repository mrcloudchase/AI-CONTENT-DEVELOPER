To use Azure Policy, you select a built-in policy definition and [create a policy assignment](/azure/governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage).\n\nBefore you assign the policy that creates Flux configurations, you must ensure that the Flux extension is deployed to your clusters. You can assign a policy to ensure the extension is deployed to all clusters in the selected scope (all resource groups in a subscription or management group, or to specific resource groups). Then, when creating the policy assignment to deploy configurations, you set parameters for the Flux configuration to be applied to the clusters in that scope.\n\nTo enable separation of concerns, you can create multiple policy assignments, each with a different Flux v2 configuration pointing to a different source. For example, cluster admins can use one Git repository, while application teams use another.",
