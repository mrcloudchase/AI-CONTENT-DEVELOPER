For a software workload running outside of Azure, you need to use application credentials, such as a secret or certificate, to access resources that are protected by Microsoft Entra (such as Azure Key Vault or Azure Blob storage). These credentials pose a security risk and have to be stored securely and rotated regularly. You also run the risk of service downtime if the credentials expire.\n\nWorkload identity federation lets you configure a\u202f[user-assigned managed identity](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities)\u202for\u202f[app registration](/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals)\u202fin Microsoft Entra ID to trust tokens from an external identity provider (IdP), such as Kubernetes. The user-assigned managed identity or app registration in Microsoft Entra ID becomes an identity for software workloads running on Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters. Once that trust relationship is created, your workload can exchange trusted tokens from the Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters for access tokens from Microsoft identity platform.
