At the top of the Azure portal, search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.\n1. In the service menu, under **Manage**, select **Groups**. Then select **New group**.\n1. For **Group type**, verify that **Security** is selected. Enter a group name, such as `myJITGroup`.

Then select **Enable PIM for this group**.\n1. Select **Add assignments** to begin granting access.\n1. Under **Select role**, choose **Member**.

For example, use the `kubectl get nodes` command to view nodes in the cluster:\n\n```console\nkubectl get nodes\n```\n\nNote the authentication requirement and follow the steps to authenticate.
