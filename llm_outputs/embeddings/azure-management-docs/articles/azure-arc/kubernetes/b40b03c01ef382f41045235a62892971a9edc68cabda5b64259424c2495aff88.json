Establish a connection between your on-premises network and an Azure virtual network using a [site-to-site VPN](/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal) or [ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm) circuit.\n1. Deploy an Azure Arc Private Link Scope, which controls which Kubernetes clusters can communicate with Azure Arc over private endpoints, and associate it with your Azure virtual network using a private endpoint.\n1. Update the DNS configuration on your local network to resolve the private endpoint addresses.\n1. Configure your local firewall to allow access to Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Resource Manager, and Microsoft Container Registry.\n1.
