We have the workflow method and the langchain agent method

The create new content method needs to have better TOC entry naming to match naming convention to existing structure. I think we can fix this by having every new article get a TOC name as well. Additionally, the TOC entry placement needs more dialing in because the articles are ending up in the correct hierarchy but not in the correct order within hierarchy amongst existing content.

The removing of content method needs to actually delete files, remove the relevant TOC entry, and make a redirection entry to the most semantically relevant file so it redirects to a good replacement. The removing of content should skip review processes and needs a proper workflow summary.

The updating of existing content on large scale needs to be more open to reviewing all embeddings intensely to ensure granular changes across all files which could be a high number. Needs a better way to identify articles where changes are actually needed. Needs better workflow summary.

Needs automated resolution on files with review issues.

Needs functionality for simply reviewing content

Needs image placeholders
Needs special formatting options usage
Needs relative linking to supporting files
Needs URL referencing to supporting official site pages with absolute path cleanup
