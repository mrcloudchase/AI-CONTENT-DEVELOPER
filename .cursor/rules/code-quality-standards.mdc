# Code Quality Standards

Access with @code-quality-standards.

## Core Principles
1. **Atomic Units** - Single responsibility
2. **Clear Names** - Self-documenting
3. **No Deep Nesting** - Max 3 levels
4. **File Limit** - 500 lines

## Refactoring Patterns

### Extract Method
Break complex methods into atomic helpers.

### Guard Clauses
Use early returns instead of nested ifs.

### Strategy Pattern
Replace large switch/if-else blocks.

## File Management
- Check sizes: `find . -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -rn`
- Split by responsibility or feature
