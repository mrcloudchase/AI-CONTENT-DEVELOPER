# Strategy Generation Updates

## Overview

The content strategy generation has been updated to provide more accurate gap analysis and better decision-making by:
1. Including full material content in the prompt (not just summaries)
2. Limiting analysis to the top 3 most relevant files
3. Enabling comprehensive content comparison with NO truncation

## Changes Made

### 1. Full Material Content
- **Previous**: Only material summaries were passed to the strategy prompt
- **Now**: Complete, untruncated material content is included for detailed gap analysis
- **Benefit**: LLM can perform accurate content comparison between materials and existing documentation

### 2. Top 3 Files Only
- **Previous**: Up to 10 relevant files were analyzed
- **Now**: Only the top 3 most relevant files are included
- **Benefit**: More focused analysis while still maintaining complete content visibility

### 3. No Content Truncation
- **Previous**: Content was truncated at various limits
- **Now**: Both materials and files are passed with their complete content
- **Benefit**: Full context for comprehensive gap analysis

### 4. Enhanced Gap Analysis
The prompt now emphasizes:
- Detailed comparison between full material content and existing docs
- Section-by-section gap identification
- Evidence-based decision making

## Implementation Details

### MaterialProcessor Changes
```python
# Added to _summarize method
result['full_content'] = content
result['source'] = source
```

### ContentStrategyProcessor Changes
```python
# Updated file selection
top_files = sorted(file_relevance.items(), 
                  key=lambda x: x[1]['combined_score'], 
                  reverse=True)[:3]  # Changed from [:10]

# Enhanced material formatting - NO TRUNCATION
def _format_materials_summary(self, materials: List[Dict]) -> str:
    # Now includes complete full content without any truncation
```

### Prompt Updates
```python
# Files display - NO TRUNCATION
def _format_files_for_display(relevant_files):
    # Shows complete file content without any truncation
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Context**: Strategy decisions based on full content, not truncated versions
2. **More Accurate Decisions**: No missing information due to truncation
3. **Better Gap Identification**: Can identify all missing sections or concepts
4. **Focused Analysis**: Top 3 files provide sufficient context without overwhelming the prompt

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the changes:
```bash
./scripts/test_strategy_changes.sh
```

This will run a phase 2 analysis and you can verify in the output that:
- Materials include complete full content
- Files include complete full content
- Only 3 files are analyzed
- No truncation indicators appear in the prompt
