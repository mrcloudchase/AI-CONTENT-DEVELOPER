## Key Changes Highlighted

### Phase 4/5 Swap
All documentation now correctly reflects that:
- **Phase 4** is Content Remediation (SEO, Security, Accuracy)
- **Phase 5** is TOC Management
- Content is applied to repository after Phase 4 remediation (not Phase 3)

### Remediation Process
Documented the three-step remediation process:
1. **SEO Optimization** - Title tags, meta descriptions, keywords
2. **Security Remediation** - Remove credentials, sanitize IPs
3. **Accuracy Validation** - Cross-reference with materials

### Step Tracking
Added information about the step tracking system that monitors phase and step execution for better debugging and progress monitoring.

### Dynamic Content Types
Documented how content types are dynamically loaded from `content_standards.json` without requiring code changes.

### Prompt Organization
Clarified that prompts are organized by phase (phase1-5) with supporting prompts in a separate directory.

## Recommendations for Future Updates

1. **Add API Documentation** - Consider generating API docs with Sphinx
2. **Include Performance Metrics** - Add benchmarks and optimization guides
3. **Create Video Tutorials** - For complex workflows like remediation
4. **Add Integration Examples** - Show how to integrate with CI/CD pipelines
5. **Expand Troubleshooting** - Add more real-world error scenarios
