# Pre-Generation Material Sufficiency Check

## Overview

The AI Content Developer now performs material sufficiency checks **BEFORE** generating content to save time and API costs. This feature evaluates whether the provided materials contain enough information to create high-quality documentation that meets the content goals.

## How It Works

### 1. Pre-Generation Analysis
Before attempting to generate content, the system:
- Analyzes the planned content sections against available materials
- Evaluates technical depth and coverage for each section
- Identifies critical gaps that would affect quality
- Provides a coverage percentage (0-100%)

### 2. Decision Points

#### High Coverage (>70%)
- Proceeds with content generation
- Shows success message: `‚úì Material coverage: 85% - Materials provide comprehensive coverage...`

#### Partial Coverage (30-70%)
- Proceeds with generation but shows warnings
- Displays missing topics and suggestions
- Example:
  ```
  Pre-generation Material Coverage: 60% (Partial)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Materials lack detailed technical specifications...
  Topics with limited coverage:
    ‚Ä¢ Troubleshooting procedures
    ‚Ä¢ Configuration examples
    ‚Ä¢ Performance optimization
  ```

#### Low Coverage (<30%)
- **Skips content generation** to avoid wasting resources
- Shows error with detailed explanation
- Lists required materials
- Example:
  ```
  ‚ùå Insufficient Materials
  Material coverage too low: 25%
  The provided materials only cover high-level concepts...
  
  Critical missing topics:
    ‚Ä¢ API specifications
    ‚Ä¢ Implementation details
    ‚Ä¢ Code examples
    ‚Ä¢ Best practices
    ‚Ä¢ Error handling
  
  Required materials:
    ‚Ä¢ Technical design documentation
    ‚Ä¢ API reference guide
    ‚Ä¢ Implementation examples
  ```

### 3. AI Thinking Display

The system shows the AI's analysis process:

## Benefits

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Avoids expensive LLM calls when materials are insufficient
2. **Time Savings**: Prevents wasted time generating low-quality content
3. **Quality Assurance**: Ensures generated content has proper material support
4. **Clear Feedback**: Provides specific guidance on what materials are needed
5. **User Control**: Allows users to add materials before proceeding

## Configuration

The feature is enabled by default when `check_material_sufficiency` is `True` in the Config.

To disable (not recommended):
```python
config.check_material_sufficiency = False
```

## Results Display

In the final results, skipped items are clearly shown:

```
‚ú® Generation Results:
  ‚Ä¢ Created: 2/2
  ‚Ä¢ Updated: 1/1
  ‚Ä¢ Skipped (by design): 2
  ‚Ä¢ Skipped (insufficient materials): 1

‚ö†Ô∏è  Skipped Due to Insufficient Materials:
  ‚Ä¢ Troubleshooting Guide for Cilium Issues
    Coverage: 20% - Material coverage too low
    Missing topics: Diagnostic procedures, Log analysis, Common errors
```

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Comprehensive Materials**: Include technical specs, examples, and detailed documentation
2. **Review Skip Warnings**: If content is skipped, add the suggested materials
3. **Iterative Approach**: Run analysis, add materials, re-run until coverage is sufficient
4. **Material Types**: Include:
   - Technical specifications
   - API documentation
   - Code examples
   - Best practices guides
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Architecture diagrams (as descriptions)

## Troubleshooting

### Content Still Generated Despite Low Coverage
- Check if coverage is above 30% threshold
- The system allows generation between 30-70% with warnings

### False Positives (Materials Are Sufficient)
- Ensure materials are properly extracted (check --content-limit)
- Verify material summaries accurately represent content
- Check that technical details aren't being truncated
