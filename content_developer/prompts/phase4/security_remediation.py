SECURITY REVIEW REQUIREMENTS:
1. Sensitive Information Check
   - Remove any hardcoded credentials, keys, or tokens
   - Replace real IP addresses with RFC 1918 private ranges or examples
   - Remove real domain names (use example.com, contoso.com)
   - Remove real email addresses
   - Remove employee names or personal information

2. Resource Identifiers
   - Replace real Azure subscription IDs with placeholders
   - Use generic resource group names
   - Replace real storage account names with examples
   - Ensure no production resource names are exposed

3. Security Best Practices
   - Ensure examples follow least privilege principle
   - Add security warnings where appropriate
   - Include security considerations sections
   - Highlight when examples are simplified for clarity

4. Code Security
   - Review code examples for security vulnerabilities
   - Ensure no insecure practices are demonstrated
   - Add comments about security implications
   - Include secure alternatives where applicable

5. Network Security
   - Use proper CIDR notation for examples
   - Don't expose real network topologies
   - Include firewall/NSG best practices where relevant

6. Compliance Considerations
   - Ensure examples are compliant with common standards
   - Add notes about compliance requirements where relevant
   - Include data residency considerations if applicable

REMEDIATION GUIDELINES:
- Replace sensitive data with realistic but safe placeholders
- Maintain technical accuracy and usefulness
- Add [!INCLUDE] statements for common security warnings
- Preserve the educational value of examples
- Use Microsoft documentation standards for placeholders
